## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: App flashes open and crashes

```powershell
# Run the fix script
.\windows-fix-webview2.ps1 -Force
```

If this doesn't work:
```powershell
# Complete cleanup and reinstall
.\windows-cleanup-webview2.ps1 -Force
# Then reinstall the app as regular user
```

### Scenario 2: "Run as Administrator" error

**Problem**: Someone ran the app as Administrator, now it won't work for regular users.

**Solution**:
```powershell
# As the regular user who needs to use the app
.\windows-cleanup-webview2.ps1 -Force
# Then reinstall as regular user (NOT as Administrator)
```

### Scenario 3: Multi-user system

**Problem**: User A installed the app, User B can't run it.

**Solution**: User B should:
```powershell
# User B runs this in their own PowerShell window
.\windows-cleanup-webview2.ps1 -Force
# Then User B installs their own copy
```

### Scenario 4: Permission denied errors

```powershell
# First try automatic fix
.\windows-fix-webview2.ps1 -Force -Verbose

# If that fails, use cleanup
.\windows-cleanup-webview2.ps1 -Force
```

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or later
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Regular user account (scripts work best as regular user)

## Troubleshooting

### Script won't run - "Execution Policy" error

```powershell
# Allow script execution for current session
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

# Then run the script
.\windows-fix-webview2.ps1
```

### "Access denied" errors

1. Close all BEAR LLM AI windows
2. Run PowerShell as **regular user** (not Administrator)
3. Run the cleanup script with -Force:
   ```powershell
   .\windows-cleanup-webview2.ps1 -Force
   ```

### Scripts don't fix the issue

If automated fixes don't work:

1. **Manual cleanup**:
   - Close all BEAR LLM AI windows
   - Open File Explorer
   - Navigate to: `%LOCALAPPDATA%`
   - Delete `com.bearllm.ai` folder
   - Reinstall as regular user

2. **Check Windows Event Viewer**:
   ```
   Win + R ‚Üí eventvwr.msc ‚Üí Windows Logs ‚Üí Application
   ```
   Look for BEAR LLM AI or WebView2 errors

3. **Report issue** with:
   - Script output
   - Event Viewer logs
   - Windows version
   - User account type

## Best Practices

1. **Always run as regular user**
   - Never use "Run as Administrator" for these scripts
   - Never use "Run as Administrator" for the app

2. **One user per installation**
   - Each Windows user should install their own copy
   - Use "Install for current user only" during installation

3. **After cleanup, always reinstall**
   - Don't just fix permissions and keep old installation
   - Clean reinstall ensures no lingering issues

4. **Backup data before cleanup**
   - Chat histories are stored in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\com.bearllm.ai\data.db`
   - Copy this file before running cleanup script if you want to preserve data
