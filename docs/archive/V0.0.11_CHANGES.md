# Version 0.0.11 Changes - Out-of-Box Windows Installation

## Summary

Version 0.0.11 implements **automatic dependency installation** to ensure BEAR LLM AI works out of the box on Windows with **no manual steps required**.

## Critical Fix: "App Can't Run" Error

### Problem
Users reported that v0.0.11 showed "This app can't run on your PC" error, caused by missing Visual C++ Runtime.

### Solution
Implemented NSIS installer hooks that automatically bundle and install all required dependencies.

## What Changed

### 1. New Files Created

#### `/src-tauri/windows/hooks.nsh` (NEW)
NSIS installer hooks that automatically:
- Check for existing VC++ Runtime installation
- Install VC++ Runtime silently if missing
- Verify WebView2 availability
- Clean up temporary files

#### `/src-tauri/resources/windows/vc_redist.x64.exe` (NEW)
Visual C++ Redistributable 2015-2022 (x64) installer
- Size: 25MB
- Bundled with application installer
- Installed automatically during setup

### 2. Configuration Updates

#### `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
```json
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "nsis": {
        "installerHooks": "./windows/hooks.nsh"  // ‚Üê NEW
      }
    },
    "resources": [
      "WebView2Loader.dll",
      "resources/*",
      "resources/windows/vc_redist.x64.exe"  // ‚Üê NEW
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3. Documentation Added

- `/docs/OUT_OF_BOX_WINDOWS_INSTALLATION.md` - Complete implementation guide
- `/docs/WINDOWS_EXECUTION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Troubleshooting reference

## Technical Details

### NSIS Hooks Implementation

**Pre-Install Hook** (`NSIS_HOOK_PREINSTALL`):
- Validates Windows version (10 1809+ or 11)
- Shows user-friendly error for unsupported systems

**Post-Install Hook** (`NSIS_HOOK_POSTINSTALL`):
1. Checks registry for existing VC++ Runtime:
   - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VisualStudio\14.0\VC\Runtimes\x64`
   - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\VisualStudio\14.0\VC\Runtimes\x64`
2. If not found, extracts and runs `vc_redist.x64.exe`
3. Installation flags: `/install /quiet /norestart`
4. Cleans up temporary files
5. Logs all steps for debugging

**Uninstall Hook** (`NSIS_HOOK_UNINSTALL`):
- Removes application files
- Preserves VC++ Runtime (other apps may depend on it)

### Exit Code Handling

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 0 | Success | Continue |
| 1638 | Newer version exists | Skip (satisfied) |
| 3010 | Restart required | Note but don't restart |
| Other | Error | Log and continue |

## Impact

### Installer Size
- **Before**: ~15MB (app only)
- **After**: ~40MB (app + 25MB VC++ Runtime)
- **Trade-off**: +25MB for zero-configuration experience

### Installation Time
- **Added**: ~30 seconds for VC++ installation (if needed)
- **Silent**: User sees progress bar, no interruption
- **Skipped**: If VC++ already installed (instant)

### User Experience

#### Before (Manual Installation)
```
1. Download installer
2. Run installer
3. Launch app ‚Üí CRASH ‚ùå
4. Search error online
5. Find "need VC++ Runtime"
6. Download VC++ separately
7. Install VC++ manually
8. Restart computer
9. Launch app again ‚Üí Finally works ‚úÖ
```

#### After (Automatic Installation)
```
1. Download installer
2. Run installer ‚Üí All dependencies handled ‚úÖ
3. Launch app ‚Üí Works immediately ‚úÖ
```

## Testing Requirements

Before releasing v0.0.11, test on:

1. **Fresh Windows 10** (no VC++ Runtime)
   - Expected: VC++ installed automatically
   - Result: App launches successfully

2. **Fresh Windows 11** (no VC++ Runtime)
   - Expected: VC++ installed automatically
   - Result: App launches successfully

3. **Windows with existing VC++ Runtime**
   - Expected: Registry check passes, skip installation
   - Result: Fast installation, app launches

4. **Windows with newer VC++ version**
   - Expected: Exit code 1638, skip installation
   - Result: App launches successfully

5. **Limited user account** (current user install)
   - Expected: Install to %LOCALAPPDATA%
   - Result: No admin prompt, works correctly

6. **Administrator account** (all users install)
   - Expected: Install to Program Files
   - Result: Available to all users

## Build Instructions

### Standard Build
```bash
# Build as usual - NSIS hooks run automatically
pnpm tauri build
```

### Verify Bundled Files
After build, check:
```bash
# Installer should include:
- Application files
- WebView2Loader.dll
- resources/windows/vc_redist.x64.exe (25MB)

# hooks.nsh should be compiled into installer
```

### Output Location
```
src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ BEAR-LLM-AI_0.0.11_x64-setup.exe (~40MB)
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, revert by:

1. Remove NSIS hooks:
```json
// tauri.conf.json
"nsis": {
  // Remove: "installerHooks": "./windows/hooks.nsh"
}
```

2. Remove VC++ from resources:
```json
"resources": [
  "WebView2Loader.dll",
  "resources/*"
  // Remove: "resources/windows/vc_redist.x64.exe"
]
```

3. Delete files:
```bash
rm -rf src-tauri/windows/
rm -rf src-tauri/resources/windows/
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Internet Required**: First install may need internet for WebView2 download
2. **Installer Size**: Increased by 25MB (acceptable trade-off)
3. **Installation Time**: Adds ~30 seconds (only if VC++ needed)
4. **Registry Access**: Requires registry read permissions (standard)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Offline WebView2**: Bundle fixed WebView2 version (+180MB)
2. **Compressed Runtime**: Use LZMA compression on VC++ installer
3. **Progress UI**: Custom branded installation screen
4. **Diagnostic Mode**: Verbose logging option for troubleshooting

## Migration Notes

### For Users
- **Upgrading from v0.0.10**: Uninstall old version first
- **Fresh Install**: No manual steps required
- **Corporate Environments**: May need IT approval for VC++ installation

### For Developers
- **New Build Output**: Installer size increased to ~40MB
- **CI/CD**: No changes needed (NSIS hooks run automatically)
- **Testing**: Verify on fresh Windows VM before release

## Support Impact

### Expected Reduction in Support Tickets
- ‚ùå "App won't start" ‚Üí Eliminated
- ‚ùå "Missing VCRUNTIME140.dll" ‚Üí Eliminated
- ‚ùå "How do I install VC++ Runtime?" ‚Üí Eliminated
- ‚úÖ App works out of the box

### Remaining Support Topics
- Configuration questions
- Feature requests
- Bug reports (not dependency-related)
