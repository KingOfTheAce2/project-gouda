## üîß Critical Bug Fix: WebView2 Multi-User Permission Issues

### Problem Summary

Users experienced crashes and permission errors when:
- Installing as one user and running as another
- Running the application as Administrator
- Switching between user accounts on Windows

**Error Message**:
```
The data folder cannot be created.
Microsoft Edge cannot read from and write to its data folder:
C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\com.bearllm.ai\EBWebView
```

### Root Cause

WebView2 creates user-specific data folders in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\com.bearllm.ai\EBWebView`. When different users or administrators tried to access these folders, Windows permission restrictions caused:
1. **Permission denied errors** - Folder owned by different user
2. **Immediate crashes** - App flashing open and closing
3. **Silent failures** - No clear error messages

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Automatic WebView2 Permission Management (src-tauri/src/init.rs)

**New Features**:
- ‚úÖ **Startup verification**: Checks WebView2 folder permissions on every launch
- ‚úÖ **Write permission test**: Creates test file to verify access
- ‚úÖ **Automatic recovery**: Removes and recreates folder if permissions fail
- ‚úÖ **Environment variable**: Sets `WEBVIEW2_USER_DATA_FOLDER` explicitly
- ‚úÖ **Detailed logging**: All operations logged for diagnostics
- ‚úÖ **Cross-platform**: Windows-specific code with no-op on other platforms

**Code Changes**:
```rust
// New function: setup_webview2_user_data_folder()
// - Windows-only implementation with #[cfg(target_os = "windows")]
// - Checks if folder exists and is writable
// - Automatically recreates with proper permissions if needed
// - Sets environment variable for WebView2
```

#### 2. Enhanced Installer Configuration (src-tauri/tauri.conf.json)

**Updated Settings**:
```json
{
  "windows": {
    "nsis": {
      "installMode": "currentUser",  // Forces per-user installation
      "deleteAppDataOnUninstall": false  // Preserves user data
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3. PowerShell Diagnostic and Fix Scripts

**New Scripts** (`scripts/`):

##### A. `windows-fix-webview2.ps1`
- **Purpose**: Diagnose and fix permission issues without data loss
- **Features**:
  - Check folder ownership and permissions
  - Verify write access with test file
  - Automatic permission repair with `-Force`
  - WebView2 runtime version detection
  - Detailed diagnostic output
- **Usage**: `.\windows-fix-webview2.ps1 -Force -Verbose`

##### B. `windows-cleanup-webview2.ps1`
- **Purpose**: Complete cleanup for fresh reinstall
- **Features**:
  - Takes ownership of app data folders
  - Removes all BEAR LLM AI data
  - Cleans related WebView2 folders
  - Safe confirmation prompts
- **Usage**: `.\windows-cleanup-webview2.ps1 -Force`
- **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: Deletes all chat histories and settings

#### 4. Comprehensive Documentation Updates

**Enhanced Documentation** (`docs/WINDOWS_MULTI_USER_GUIDE.md`):
- ‚úÖ New "Quick Fix" section with automated scripts
- ‚úÖ Technical details explaining the fix mechanism
- ‚úÖ Log file locations and what to look for
- ‚úÖ Manual permission fix commands
- ‚úÖ Step-by-step troubleshooting guide
- ‚úÖ Updated for version 0.0.3+ features

**New Documentation** (`scripts/README.md`):
- ‚úÖ Detailed script usage instructions
- ‚úÖ Common scenario solutions
- ‚úÖ Troubleshooting guide
- ‚úÖ Best practices for multi-user systems

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Fresh install as User A, run as User A
- [ ] Install as User A, run as User B (should fail gracefully with clear message)
- [ ] Install as User A, run as Administrator (should fail gracefully)
- [ ] Install as regular user, check WebView2 folder permissions
- [ ] Test automatic permission recovery on corrupted folder
- [ ] Verify logging output in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\com.bearllm.ai\logs\`
- [ ] Run `windows-fix-webview2.ps1` script on problematic installation
- [ ] Run `windows-cleanup-webview2.ps1` and verify complete cleanup
- [ ] Test reinstall after cleanup
- [ ] Verify no regressions on macOS/Linux (no-op code)

### Migration Guide

#### For Users on 0.0.2 or Earlier

**Recommended Upgrade Path**:

1. **Backup your data** (optional):
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\com.bearllm.ai\data.db" "$HOME\Desktop\bear-llm-backup.db"
   ```

2. **Run cleanup script**:
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\windows-cleanup-webview2.ps1 -Force
   ```

3. **Install version 0.0.3**:
   - Download new installer
   - Run as **regular user** (not Administrator)
   - Choose "Install for current user only"

4. **Launch and verify**:
   - App should start without errors
   - Check logs: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\com.bearllm.ai\logs\`
   - Look for: "WebView2 folder permissions verified"

#### For Developers

**Build Instructions**:

```bash
# Update version (already done in this commit)
# src-tauri/Cargo.toml: version = "0.0.3"
# src-tauri/tauri.conf.json: version = "0.0.3"

# Build on Windows
pnpm tauri build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc

# Build on Linux (cross-compile not recommended, use Windows VM)
# Build on macOS (cross-compile not supported)
```

**Code Review Points**:
- `src-tauri/src/init.rs:13-68` - WebView2 permission handling
- `src-tauri/src/init.rs:100-105` - Integration with app initialization
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json:32-39` - NSIS installer configuration
- `scripts/windows-fix-webview2.ps1` - Diagnostic script
- `scripts/windows-cleanup-webview2.ps1` - Cleanup script

### Known Limitations

1. **Administrator installations not supported**
   - By design - prevents multi-user permission issues
   - Error message guides users to reinstall as regular user

2. **No automatic data migration between users**
   - Each user has isolated data folder
   - Intentional for privacy and permissions

3. **Windows-only fix**
   - macOS and Linux don't have this permission model
   - No-op functions on other platforms

### Future Improvements

- [ ] Detect and warn if running as Administrator before window opens
- [ ] Automatic migration script for moving data between users (if requested)
- [ ] Better error dialog with link to troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Telemetry for permission error frequency
- [ ] Pre-flight checks before launching WebView
