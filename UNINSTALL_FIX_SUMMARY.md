# Summary: Uninstall and WebView2 Fixes

## Your Original Issue

After uninstalling BEAR LLM AI, these files remained:
- `C:\Users\Gassen\AppData\Local\BEAR LLM AI\preinit.log`
- `C:\Users\Gassen\AppData\Local\BEAR LLM AI\WebView2\`

**You asked**: "Should that not be removed after uninstalling?"

**Answer**: YES! And now it will be properly handled.

---

## What I Fixed

### 1. ✅ Proper Uninstall Cleanup

**Changes in**: `src-tauri/windows/hooks.nsh` (lines 105-165)

The uninstaller now gives you **TWO OPTIONS**:

#### Option 1: Remove ALL Data (Choose "Yes")
When you click "Yes", **EVERYTHING** is removed:
- ✅ All application files
- ✅ `preinit.log` - DELETED
- ✅ `WebView2\` folder - DELETED
- ✅ Database and settings - DELETED
- ✅ Complete folder removal from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BEAR LLM AI`

**Result**: Clean system, nothing left behind

#### Option 2: Keep User Data (Choose "No")
When you click "No", only temporary files are removed:
- ✅ `preinit.log` - DELETED
- ✅ `fatal_error.log` - DELETED
- ✅ `crash.log` - DELETED
- ✅ `WebView2\` folder - DELETED
- ✗ Database - PRESERVED
- ✗ Settings - PRESERVED

**Result**: Your data is safe for future reinstalls

### 2. ✅ Fixed WebView2 Initialization Issues

**Changes in**: `src-tauri/src/main.rs` (lines 70-154)

Your logs showed WebView2 was detected but the app still crashed. I fixed this by:

1. **Automatic corruption detection**: Checks if WebView2 cache is writable
2. **Auto-recovery**: Automatically deletes and recreates corrupted cache
3. **Better initialization**: Sets multiple environment variables for reliability
4. **Delayed window**: Window only shows after successful initialization

### 3. ✅ Created Fix Script

**New file**: `scripts/fix-webview2-windows.bat`

A one-click solution for users experiencing issues:
```batch
scripts\fix-webview2-windows.bat
```

This script automatically:
- Clears corrupted WebView2 cache
- Verifies dependencies are installed
- Checks folder permissions
- Opens logs for inspection
