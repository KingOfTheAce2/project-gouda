- ✅ Logs to preinit.log with timestamps
- ✅ Provides detailed installation instructions on failure

**Comparison with BEAR-LLM**:
- ✅ Identical approach and timing
- ✅ Same logging strategy
- ✅ Enhanced error messages with download links

#### ✅ WebView2 User Data Folder Setup (main.rs, lines 70-154)

- ✅ Creates folder in LocalAppData/BEAR LLM AI/WebView2
- ✅ Tests write permissions before use
- ✅ Auto-recovers from corrupted cache
- ✅ Sets both WEBVIEW2_USER_DATA_FOLDER and WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS
- ✅ Comprehensive logging of all operations

**Comparison with BEAR-LLM**:
- ✅ Same timing (before Tauri init)
- ✅ Same folder structure
- ✅ Enhanced with permission checks
- ✅ Added auto-recovery logic

#### ✅ Runtime Detection (crash_handler.rs, lines 100-160)
**Purpose**: Detect WebView2 runtime using multiple methods

**Validation Points**:
- ✅ Method 1: Registry check (EdgeUpdate clients)
- ✅ Method 2: Filesystem check (system paths)
- ✅ Method 3: Edge browser detection (fallback)
- ✅ Comprehensive logging of detection results
- ✅ Clear error messages when not found

**Comparison with BEAR-LLM**:

**Validation**:
- ✅ Setup now at lines 70-154 in main.rs
- ✅ Runs before line 170 (Tauri Builder)
- ✅ Environment variables set before WebView2 initialization

## 6. Known Limitations & Considerations

### 6.1 Platform-Specific Behavior

**Windows-Only Features**:
- WebView2 detection (Windows-specific)
- VC++ runtime checks (Windows-specific)
- Registry access (Windows-specific)

**Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
- ✅ Proper #[cfg(target_os = "windows")] guards in place
- ✅ Non-Windows platforms skip checks gracefully
- ✅ No platform-specific code outside guards

### 6.2 External Dependencies

**Required Components**:
1. WebView2 Runtime (or Edge browser)
2. Visual C++ 2015-2022 Redistributable (x64 and x86)
3. Windows 10 1809 or later

**Mitigation**: All dependencies checked at launch with clear error messages

### 6.3 Edge Cases Handled

✅ **WebView2 partially installed**: Multiple detection methods ensure coverage
✅ **Corrupted registry**: Filesystem fallback detection works
✅ **Permission issues**: Write checks and auto-recovery implemented
✅ **Unicode paths**: Rust PathBuf handles correctly
✅ **Concurrent launches**: Each instance manages its own state
